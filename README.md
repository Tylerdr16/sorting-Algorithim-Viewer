# sorting-Algorithim-Viewer
A practice project I made to work with sorting algorithms more. Allows users to create a file to turn into an array to sort in various ways.

This project was made to help me strengthen my understanding of sorting algorithms.
The code allows you to view a menu and choose from various options to view the various algorithms.
You can also read and write to a file in the code to edit the randomized list and sort it.
The file is named Pokemon.txt because during development I used various Pokemon names to create a randomized list.
Thank you for viewing my project.
